# Wave-D.E.-Project
Project 4 of Numerical Methods
In this project we solved the wave differential equation in 1+1 dimensions for a domain extending in [-1,1] in x direction and [0,4] in t direction. We discretized this domain and assuming some initial conditions and Dirichlet boundary conditions we found the solution in all of the points of the domain, for different grid spacings. We also computed the energy density and the total energy as a funcion of time. For the last we commented on its conservation.
